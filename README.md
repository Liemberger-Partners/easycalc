# WB-EasyCalc

WB-EasyCalc was designed in 2006 to help water utilities and consultants to properly apply the IWA Water Loss Specialist Group Methodology.
During the last 10 years it has become the preferred NRW analysis tool for water utilities around the world. To celebrate its 10th anniversary, version 5 has been launched in August 2016.

The current version is 6.17.

### Languages and World Bank Terminology

The pre-set Language is English using the IWA terminology. If you would like to use the World Bank favored terms "Physical Losses" and "Commercial Losses" instead of the IWA terms "Real Losses" and "Apparent Losses" click on the button "change language" and select code 2.

In the World Bank Terminology, the IWA terms "UARL - Unavoidable Annual Volume of Real Losses" and "CARL - Current Annual Volume of Real Losses" were replaced with the World Bank favored terms "MAPL - Minimum Achievable Annual Volume of Physical Losses" and "CAPL - Current Annual Volume of Physical Losses". However, the underlying formula remained of course unchanged.

Currently, the following languages are implemented:

- "IWA Teminology (English)"
- World Bank reccomended Terminology (US English)
- French
- Deutsch
- Russian
- Vietnamese
- Bahasa Indonesia
- EspaÃ±ol
- Italian
- Portuguese (Brazil)
- Hungarian
- Arabic
- Thai
- Serbian
- Chinese (1)
- Chinese (2)
- Chinese (3)
- Romanian
- Bosnian
- Albanian
- Georgian
- Bulgarian
- Czech
- Greek

### General Disclaimer

While every effort has been made by the developers to ensure that WB-EasyCalc is free from error, those using the model do so at their own risk. Liemberger & Partners accept no liability of any nature for losses (direct or indirect) incurred through the use of this model.

The program is protected with passwords which will not be revealed.

### GIGO - Garbage in Garbage out!

The user has to be aware that results calculated with this program can be extremely wrong if base data is wrong or incomplete.

### Gerneal Notes

It is ALWAYS recommended to carry out a thorough leakage analysis based on measurements in the distribution network to support and verify the physical loss figure calculated with this program.

When using this program for the first time, it is recommended to first familiarize with the methodology. A complete set of background reading materials can be downloaded from [www.liemberger.cc](https://www.liemberger.cc).

### Feedback

Liemberger & Partners would appreciate feedback! Please send your comments to office@liemberger.cc

WB-EasyCalc will be continuously improved and upgraded - revisit [www.liemberger.cc](https://www.liemberger.cc) from time to time to check for new versions.
